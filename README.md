# OpenKool

This application is an open source fork of kOOL form [churchtool.org](http://www.churchtool.org) which is maintained closed source on [laupercomputing.ch/kool](https://www.laupercomputing.ch/kool).

As kOOL is built on old software and never had a good architecture, it would be too much work to make it first class church organization software which is able to compete with ChurchTools or Planning Center. However, kOOL is the most advanced open source church organization software which is currently available. This fork aims to keep kOOL operational for next years until there are better alternatives available.

## Installation
The recommended deployment option is to use Docker containers. An example _Compose file_ is available in the `docs` folder.
